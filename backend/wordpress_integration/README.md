# WordPress Integration â€“ Aristotle TV

This folder contains the custom WordPress plugin that integrates the Aristotle TV backend with the WordPress frontend using RabbitMQ.

The plugin acts as the **entry point** for video/audio processing by publishing metadata to RabbitMQ when a new post is created.

---

## What It Does

1. Listens for the creation of a new **WordPress post** of type `video`.
2. Waits for a **Forminator form** submission to get the uploaded file path.
3. Combines the `post_id` and `file_path` into a JSON message.
4. Publishes the message to RabbitMQ using PHP's AMQP library.

This triggers the backend processing pipeline (e.g., transcription, tagging, NER, etc.).
